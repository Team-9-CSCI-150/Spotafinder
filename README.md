Group Project for CSCI 150, Dr. Alex Liu @ California State University, Fresno

Team members: Vince Trien Ngo, Khai Pham, Brian Cardwell, David Rodriguez, Israel Perez

# Background

The purpose of the project is to solve the problem of student on campus needing to search endlessly for a space to study, and sometimes a non-crowded place to study.

This issue can be solved by developing a mobile app that can readily available to all student that report to them what study room/library sections are not congested. By setting up Raspberry Pi Zero Ws to sniff for Wifi signals within a defined radius the level of congestion can be measured. This data can then be sent to a firebase data base to record and then a mobile developed using react native can interact with that data and display it to a user.
